## NetworkManager
I choose `NetworkManager` as my profile name 'cause my identity in real life - who is a 15 y/o senior high school student - is also referred to as `NetworkManager` for they are the only one who knows a little bit of informatics.

## How to reach me
Simple.

If you are using Arch Linux like I do, just type the following command in your terminal and `pacman` would invite me to your computer to have a look:
```shell
sudo pacman -Sy NetworkManager
```

### My accounts on social media
```python
def retrieveMySocialMediaAccount() -> None: return
```

### Devices I currently own / use
`Lenovo V110-14AST` - my laptop. OSes running on it are:

```
