Yeah - I know. You don't want to waste your time reading a LOOOOOOOONG README about a random guy you see on the internet.

So umm, for a detailed version of this README, visit [Here](https://github.com/nwkman/nwkman/blob/main/readme-detailed-en.md) for the English version or
[Here](https://github.com/nwkman/nwkman/blob/main/readme-detailed-zh.md) for the Chinese one.

After saying a pack of useless words, nice to meet you, stranger!

I'm @nwkman, a cyber-identity of another random guy in real life. For some reasons they don't want to use their
own identity when they are surfing on the internet.

My information is given by the following lines of code:

```python
languages_I_use = ['zh-cn', 'en-us', 'C', 'C++', 'Python']
primary_language = languages_I_use[0]
pronouns = ['they', 'their', 'them', 'she', 'hers', 'her']
hobbies = ('coding',)
status = ['Preparing for NOIP']
gender = {'cyber': 'female', 'irl': None}
age = 15
```

I speak poor English, by the way, 'cause I was born in a little city somewhere in China. Pointing out my grammar problems is welcomed.

And that's all.
